***NinoImager*** is a tool to import and export images from the Nintendo DS game *"Ni no kuni: Shikkoku no Mad≈çshi"*. It supports NPCK pack files (N2D and N3D) and all NitroImage formats:
* Background: NCLR + NCGR + NSCR
* Sprites: NCLR + NCGR + NCER
* Textures: BTX0 (TEX0) and BMD0 (only texture support).

It allows to do batch imports so all images can be imported in just one click. It can also update [modime](https://github.com/pleonex/modime) XML translation files. It has been made for the Spanish translation, more info [here](http://www.gradienwords.tk/Ninokuniproject/). Also it's being used by the Italian translation.
